                <p>Kamikazee is a Filipino rock band formed in 2000. <br><br>The band is composed of Jay Contreras, Jomal Linao, Led Tuyay, Puto Astete and Bords Burdeos. The band is composed of five members who met in college at the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines, Diliman.
                Kamikazee's early gigs were mostly on campus events in UP Diliman like the annual UP Fair. Before they were signed in a major label, they went by the name "Kamikazee Cornflakes" 
                    (eventually shortened to its current state as "Kamikazee" which they think is easier to remember).<br><br>Their early shows included renditions of the songs "Mmm Sarap", "Tsinelas", a cover of Ariel Rivera's "Sana Kahit Minsan", and Britney Spears' Lucky. They were known for using expletives, suggestive movements, and references to genitalia in their UP Diliman performances.</p>
